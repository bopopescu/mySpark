0. register the reduce before generate the map. algorithm is needed here to make the performance better.

1. start the shuffle map task, send the pipe metadata to the corresponding BlockManager which will run reduce taks later.

2. submit a stage if all the parent stages are running.

3. schedule the reduce tasks as soon as one of the map tasks finished.

4. reduce tasks use the metadata from BlockManager to perform data fetch instead of asking the MapOutputTracker.
